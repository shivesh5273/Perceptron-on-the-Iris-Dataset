# Perceptron on the Iris Dataset

## 📚 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a classic machine learning experiment: building a Perceptron (the simplest neural network) from scratch to classify flowers using the famous Iris dataset.  
The code, explanations, and summary are all beginner-friendly and walk through every step, from data loading to visualizing the decision boundary.

## 🚀 What Is a Perceptron?
A Perceptron is a simple machine learning algorithm that learns to classify data by drawing a straight line (decision boundary) between two groups.  
It's the foundational building block for much of modern AI.

## 📝 Steps Covered

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**:  
   - Loaded the Iris dataset (focusing on Setosa & Versicolor species, two features).
   - Visualized data points in 2D for clarity.

2. **Perceptron Implementation**:  
   - Built the Perceptron algorithm from scratch in Python.
   - Trained it to find the best line separating the two flower types.

3. **Visualization**:  
   - Plotted the number of misclassifications as the model learned.
   - Visualized the final decision boundary.

4. **Reflection**:  
   - Included a detailed beginner summary, concepts learned, and tips for next steps.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Real-world data (like flowers) can be turned into numbers for computers to learn from.
- The Perceptron learns by making mistakes and adjusting its weights.
- Visualization helps make abstract machine learning concepts concrete.
- Limitations: Perceptrons only work if data can be separated by a straight line.

## 🏆 What I Learned

> "I learned not just how to code a perceptron, but how it 'thinks': making predictions, learning from mistakes, and drawing boundaries in data. This project made the fundamentals of machine learning real for me—and it's just the beginning!"

---

## 📈 Next Steps

- Try adding more features or using all three Iris classes.
- Experiment with other algorithms (like logistic regression or SVM).
- Explore scikit-learn’s built-in Perceptron for comparison.
